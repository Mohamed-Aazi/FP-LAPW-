# FP-LAPW-
Quantum Mechanics: FP-LAPW Method:  Uses a full-potential approach, meaning it does not approximate the shape of the potential.  Divides space into muffin-tin spheres (around atoms) and interstitial regions (between atoms).  Provides highly accurate results for band structures, density of states (DOS), and charge densities.
